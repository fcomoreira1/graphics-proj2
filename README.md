# CSE306: Computer Graphics Project 2

This repository contains my code for the second project of CSE306: Computer Graphics. A report for this project is included in `report.pdf`

A video demonstration of a fluid simulation can be found at `images/fluid_video.svg` with X fluid particles, $dt = 0.003$, volume of fluid $0.4$, $\epsilon = 0.004$, and mass for all particles $m_i = 200$.
